# Requirements Discovery

## User Story Format
```
As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit].
```

**Acceptance criteria** (Given/When/Then):

```
Given [context]
When [action]
Then [expected outcome]
```

## Discovery Questions
- Who is the user? What is their goal?
- What problem does this solve?
- What does success look like?
- What are the constraints (time, tech, compliance)?
- What could go wrong? What edge cases?

## PRD Structure
1. **Overview**: Problem, target users, success metrics
2. **Requirements**: Functional (must have) vs nice-to-have
3. **User Stories**: Prioritized with acceptance criteria
4. **Out of Scope**: Explicit boundaries
5. **Constraints**: Technical, compliance, timeline

## Success Criteria
- Measurable (e.g., "User completes X in under Y seconds")
- Testable (can be verified)
- Agreed with stakeholders

## Output Format
- **Must have**: Required for launch
- **Should have**: Important but not blocking
- **Could have**: Future enhancement
