# Core Standards

## Type Safety
- Prefer explicit types over `any`; use `unknown` when type is truly unknown, then narrow
- Avoid type assertions (`as`) unless necessary; prefer type guards or better typing

## Error Handling
- Handle errors explicitly; never swallow with empty `catch` blocks
- Log errors before rethrowing; include context (e.g., operation name, input summary)
- Use custom error classes for domain-specific failures when helpful

## Function Design
- Keep functions focused on one concern; extract when they exceed ~30 lines
- Prefer pure functions when possible; isolate side effects at boundaries
- Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting

## Naming
- Use meaningful names; avoid abbreviations except common ones (`id`, `url`, `err`, `req`, `res`)
- Booleans: `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canEdit`
- Functions: verb-first (`fetchUser`, `validateInput`, `formatDate`)

## General
- Prefer `const` over `let`; avoid `var`
- Avoid magic numbers and strings; extract to named constants
- Comment *why*, not *what*; code should be self-explanatory
